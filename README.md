# SuperUpload

When a user picks a file from their computer, the upload automatically begins. While uploading,
the percentage complete is visible on the page. It should update at least every 2 seconds.
While uploading, the user should be able to enter text into a description text area.
When the upload completes, the page should display the path to the saved file. When the user
clicks save, the current value of the description text area should be posted to the server. The
response to the form post request should display both the title and the path to the file.
